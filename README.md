## What is a BST? 
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties.The value of the key of the left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent (root) node's key. The value of the key of the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to the value of its parent (root) node's key. Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as:
left_subtree (keys) < node (key) â‰¤ right_subtree (keys).
